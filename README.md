## Introduction

This simple game consists in moving the mouse around the browser window. From time to time, balls will appear out of nowhere and begin bouncing all over the screen: if any of them hits the player's cursor, the game ends.

## Caveats

There are some features (remember, they are features, not bugs :D) which should be changed, such as:
* Balls pop out of thin air right within the browser viewport. If your cursor happens to be at that exact spot, the game is over. Ideally, balls would come in from the viewport boundaries.
* Balls appear in sets of 10 every time the user scores 40 more points. Having them appear one by one in a continuous manner would improve the user experience as it would be smoother.
* The actual bounce of the balls can be improved.
